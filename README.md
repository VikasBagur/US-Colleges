# US Colleges Salaries

**Business Task: 

Find insights on which undergraduate major, which type of college and the regions pays more once the undergraduate program is concluded.

**Data:

**Data Used:

We have 3 datasets: degrees_that_payback, salaries_by_college_type and salaries_by_region

degrees_that_payback: The data in this dataset will help students and parents choose a major based only on the starting median salary and mid career median salary for each major. They can also check the mid career salary at different percentiles.

salaries_by_college_type: This dataset contains data about the starting median salary and mid career salary for each college type. We can find the change in salary based on each college type

salaries_by_region: This dataset is similar to the salaries_by_college_type but we get the information based on each region instead of college type.

**Credibility:

The data was obtained from the Wall Street Journal based on data from Payscale, Inc. Payscale has the largest repository of salary data in the world which is collected, validated and analyzed from bith traditional and non traditional sources.

**Limitations:

The data was not directly collected by Payscale but gathered from other sources. Hence, we might not get accurate results but the results will be in the ballpark of the actual values.

**Tasks:
1. Find the average starting and mid career median salary and the change in salary for each school type
2. Find the average starting and mid career median salary and the percentage change in the salaries
